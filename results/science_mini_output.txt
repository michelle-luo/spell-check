Cystic fibrosis affects 3,000 children and young adults in the US alone
Inhaling the mists of salt water can reduce the pus and infection that fills the airways of cystic fibrosis sufferers although side effects include a nasty coughing fit and a harsh taste
That's the conclusion of two studies published in this week's issue of The New England Journal of Medicine
They found that inhaling a must with a salt content of 7 or 9% improved lung function and in some cases produced less absenteeism from school or work
Cystic fibrosis a progressive and frequently fatal genetic disease that affects about 3,000 young adults and children in the US alone is marked by a thickening of the mucus which makes it harder to clear the lungs of debris and bacteria
The salt water solution really opens up a new avenue for approaching patients with cystic fibrosis and how to treat tem," sys Dr Gil Weinmann of the US National Heart Lung and Blood Institute which sponsored one of the studies
Mark Elkins of the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney Australia and colleagues authored one of the new published studies
The team found that the 83 volunteers who regularly inhaled a 7% most of salty water had fewer breathing problems and less absenteeism from school or work than those who inhaled a solution with a salt content of under 1%.
adding salt and water to the airway surfaces of patients with cystic fibrosis is beneficial for both children and adults they conclude
All of the patients first inhaled a chemical to try to open their long passages as much as possible
In the second study U-based Assistant Professor Scott Donaldson of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and his colleagues found that a 7% slt most produced a sustained acceleration of mucus clearance and improved lung function because it helped hydrate the lungs
In an accompanying editorial Dr Felix Ratjen of the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto Canada cited several unpleasant side effects of the salt MST treatment including a bad taste coughing fits and the length 30 minutes it can take to administer
He added that in the study by Ekins and tam, patients may not have received the best long antibiotic treatment
That would make the inhaled salt water most appear more effective than it would have been if people were getting a better dug, sys Rte
Weinmann sys limitations inherent to the treatment man a salt water may "ay be just a first step in treating cystic fibrosis
Scientists have rescued a mouse immune system that was overwhelmed by a systemic blood infection But will this work in humans
Scientists have discovered how infections that invade the whole body like Maria disable the immune system and prevent it from detecting and fighting other microorganisms
The Australian and German researchers say the discovery may help scientists to develop vaccines that restore immunity in people with systemic or 'hole body infections
They publish their research today online in the journal Nature Immunology
The immune response is alerted wen specialized services of the immune system dendritic cells detect a virus or bacteria
They alert the immune system by capturing infected cells and displaying fragments or antigens of the pathogen on their surface in a process called cross
Lead researcher Dr Jose Villadangos an immunologist from the Walter and Eliza Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne sys systemic infections such as malaria or sepsis a bacterial infection of the blood over stimulate dendritic cells
This results in the immune system's critical alarm system shutting down
"his doesn't occur in local infections because only a few dendritic cells are involved Villadangos sys.
out in the case of malaria infections and sepsis dendritic cells throughout the body are concentrated on eating the immune system which prevents them from detecting and responding to any new infections
A new type of vaccine
Villadangos and colleagues managed to restore immunity in mice with an immune system compromised by sepsis
They injected them with a live vaccine made of dendritic cells that had been exposed to a secondary virus in the laboratory and subsequently displayed antigens of that virus
Villadangos says the findings show the missing link in the immunosuppressed animal is the capacity of the dendritic cells to display the antigens of new viruses
